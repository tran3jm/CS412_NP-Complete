To get all the information on our runtimes, go to test_cases and click the run_test_cases.sh program

-We've deleted our generated folder to get rid of any unnecessary information
-Our test case text files in the /test_cases folder are now the test cases we used for our graph 
-When the shell script is ran, it will now only run these test cases to validate our findings on the graph
-Test case files also now have the vertex amount via the text file name
-The /test_cases/output folder will contain all of the outputs from the test script
